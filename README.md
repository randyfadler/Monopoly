(Description created by CoPilot)

The monopoly_v11.py script is a comprehensive, GUI-based Monopoly game implemented in Python using Tkinter. Here are the key points:

Structure & Features:

The script is modular, with classes for Property, Board, Player, and several Tkinter windows for auctions, property development, trading, and final stats.
It supports both human and computer players, with logic for AI decisions (e.g., buying, mortgaging, auctions).

The game includes advanced Monopoly rules: property development, mortgaging/unmortgaging, auctions, trading, jail, chance/community chest cards, taxes, and a "Free Parking" jackpot.

There are options for a "short game" mode, saving/loading game state, and a detailed event log (both in the GUI and to a file).
GUI:

The board is drawn on a Tkinter canvas, with player markers and tooltips for property details. There are interactive dialogs for property development, trading, and auctions.
The interface is user-friendly, with clear separation of board, player info, and controls.

Code Quality:

The code is well-organized and readable, with clear separation of concerns.
There are some debug print statements and comments that help with understanding and troubleshooting.
The script is quite large (~2000 lines), but the logic is broken into manageable pieces.

Extensibility:

The design allows for easy modification or extension (e.g., adding new cards, changing rules, or improving AI).
